# -Data_Product_Stream_Lit
Our project aims to create a Streamlit app that predicts local airfare in the USA using machine learning. Users enter travel details like origin, destination, date, and cabin type. The app processes this data through a trained model to provide accurate fare estimates, helping travelers plan their budgets more effectively.
